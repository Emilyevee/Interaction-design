## Element 1- Loader Screens ##

![Loading-Screen-Animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55785835/103898558-023dae00-50ed-11eb-8e01-ba0c3920c43f.png)

Loader screens are seen by millions of people every day, they are used to give the user something to look out while they wait for their page to load. Loader screens are used as a source of information too, it makes it clearer to the reader that the page they are waiting for is loading rather than keep trying to refresh the page.  There are many different forms of loading screens, some are interactive whilst others are just basic spinning wheels, some loading screens even give you hints, tips and facts while you wait to make it more interactive for the user. There main purpose is to allow all the assets of the page to be loaded in a high quality so that when you get onto the page it is fault free with a crisp display. 

### Guidelines ###
In order to create a practical loading screen, you need to think about the positions and layout of the screen. The Loading screen should only be around 3-4 seconds, this is because you don't want to leave the user getting frustrated that the page/app hasn't loaded. The design for the Loader screen should be simple but visual, this may be the first thing a user sees entering a webpage; therefore, it is important for it to be designed with effect. With the overall positioning of the loader it is import for it to be central on the page, this is so its easy for the user to see straight away and the overall look on the page is better. It is also important for it to be central so it is clear, if the design was up in the corner it wouldn't be seen as quickly.  In terms of size it is important the loader doesn't over power the whole page, the loader should be around 200 x 200mm on a standard webpage; this size will mean it is visually clear for the user. It is important when designing a loader screen that it can easily adapted depending on what device it is being used on e.g. smartphone or laptop. It also needs to be able to adapt to sudden changes e.g. when an internet tab gets bigger/smaller, so that the user can see it at anytime. 

### Design Prototyping ### 
For the design protype the software Adobe XD was used; Adobe XD allowed for a visual representation of the loader screen to be created.  For the design three separate screens were create; the design is simple but affective, it started with just four circles. The idea of the design Is that the middle part rotates and changes size in order to represent a twist on the classic spinning wheel. Once this was perfected Text was added in order to make the page clearer; the text is also animated as it moves with the page loading, the idea of this is so when the page is loading the text gradually aligns in order for the user to see the pages progress as it is loading up.

### Coding ###
The coding for this design was done on an react appliction. The first section of coding completed was App.js; The following code was used:

Then The focus was put on the CSS of the loader screen in which was coded like this:

In evaluation the overall practicality of the loader screen was there. The loader screen created is quite a simple design however it is clear and works smoothly; following the guidelines given allowed for the design to be created professionally and help to develope the overall size of the loading icon in order so it wasn't too overwhelming on the page. Upon asking other students they said the design was sleek and professional looking, there critique was that the centre of the design should have moved faster. 



## Element 2- Hover Button ##
![jelly-button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55785835/103905859-0bcc1380-50f7-11eb-8bfe-13e874475305.png)

Hover buttons make it easy for the user to identify the difference between text and a link; they work by when hovering your mouse over a link it may change the colour, size or text on that button. 
Hover buttons inform the user that they can interact with the button and select it to be taken to a new part of the website. They are mainly only used on Webpages when viewed on laptops or desktop computers as they require a mouse to work in which smartphones and tablets don't have. For a smartphone or tablet a mobile ripple effect can be created which is similar to a hover effect; this makes it import for the hover button to be easily changeable into a ripple effect button when viewed on different devices. If a hover button was placed on a mobile applicaiton it would cause the button to get stuck in a hovered state which may confuse the user.  

### Guidelines ###
When creating a hover button it needs to be simple, clear and smoothly functioning. The button needs to be placed in a stratigical place in order to catch the users eye so they are more likely to click on it. It is also important to apply appropriate colours to the buttons so they are intutitve to the user. For dark backgrounds the buttons will want to be a lighter colour in order to stand out for the user. There also needs be text on the buttons to help indicatace there purpose and make them easily recognisable. It is also important for for the button to not be too big, the button needs to fit in with the rest of the elements on the webpage. 

### Design Prototyping ###

When prototyping the button the first step was to create two different button designs. The main colours used were black and white in order to make them stand out on the current webpage design. The idea is the design will go from white to black when hovered overed to link to the sign up page. By adding text to the button makes it extra clear where the link will take the user making it more inforamtive and clarifying it's purpose.

Upon reflection the button is a modern simplistic design, the hover feature works smoothly and clearly identifies the link to the sign up page. The use of a black and white colour scheme makes the button easily visable; the location of the button on the webpage is also good as it near other interactive elements of the webpage.

## Element 4- Forms ## 
Forms are used mostly on every webapage or applicalication. Most forms should be easy and quick to fill out so you dont ask the user to answer thousands of questions as that may stop them from wanting to complete the form.  All of the fields of the form should be clearly labelled and easily editable so that the user can correct/adapt there answer before submitting the form. Many forms are often made up of senstivie data; therefore, security on the form needs to be high so that users feel safe when putting in there personal details. Forms also always come with a user error, this is so the form can be filled out with the appropriete information and then be returned back to the user if filled in wrong. 
Many of us now have a range of devices in the home, from smartphones to desktop computers; This hightlights the importance of the form being responsive to the size of the page the user is viewing it on. 

### Guidelines ###
For this component it is important to focus on the overall guildlines. The form itself needs to allow the user to add different fields into the correct box meaning that the type of field for the question needs to match the data intended to be collected for example if the form is asking you for age, then the box should only allow you add numbers to that box; this allows for no errors in the form to be made by the user. The form also needs to be short and easily accessiable on a wide number of screens, in order to promote people to sign up as its a quick and easy process. 
The form that is going to be developed is a sign up form for a clothing brand, this will need four input fields which are 2 text based fields, 1 number field and then one calendar filed where the calendar is pre loaded as a drop down so the user can select there birthday. 
Once these fields have been created it is import to add error messages if the wrong type of data has been put in to one of the boxes, this reduces the amount of forms being put to the company with incorrect values in. 

### Design Prototyping ###
<img width="276" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-07 at 17 18 56" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55785835/103923022-7f2c5000-510c-11eb-850a-762eb81b70bc.png">
When beginning the design process the first section that was made was the approprete input boxes as you can see from this 4 fields where made. From doing research into other clothing stores sign up forms; the most commom things asked where Full name, Email, Birthday and postcode. The input boxes included of a drop down box for the postcode with the idea that when the postcode is inputted it will come up with a range of addressed for the user to select the correct one. 

<img width="700" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-07 at 17 18 18" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55785835/103923018-7dfb2300-510c-11eb-81b5-b583b75fff49.png">
Once the main fields where created the focus then shifted on to the colour scheme of the form and how it was going to be presented. The colours used are all from the colour pallete of the main website design so that the website as a whole looks professional.

Finally some more Hover buttons where created, these allow the user to select there gender and add a more complex design to the form.

Overall on reflection of the final form design, the research and guidelines created allowed for the form to successfully be created in a modern and user friendly way. It has a clear design layout that fits in with the entirety of the website and is data sensitive meaning only the correct data can be implemented.
